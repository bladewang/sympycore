Introduction
------------

This file collects the notes for credits, acknowledgments, and used
third-party software of the Sympy Core project in chronological
reversed order.

* In January 2008 a new algebra package was introduced that increased
  the performance of the directadd5 test case four-fold. The basic
  design of the algebra package was developed by Pearu Peterson and
  Fredrik Johannson.  Pearu implemented CommutativeRingWithPairs that
  is the computational base class to many algebras. Fredrik
  implemented an efficient numbers support (mpq, mpf, mpc,
  extended_number) that is one of the main factors for recent
  performance improvements. Fredrik implemented PrimitiveAlgebra class
  that is used as an universal language between different
  languages. Pearu added an expression parsing (based on the Python
  compiler package) support to PrimitiveAlgebra.

* Sympy Core uses the idea of Fredrik Johansson's research to carry
  out arithmetic operations using s-expression like structures. See

    http://sympycore.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/research/directadd5.py

  for details. The idea with added features is implemented in
  sympycore by Pearu in late December 2007. This resulted a
  considerable performance improvement in terms of creating new
  symbolic expressions and performing arithmetic operations.

* Sympy Core uses the proof-of-concept by Kirill Smelkov

    http://code.google.com/p/sympy/issues/detail?id=440

  (see comment #10) for using Python AST structures to parse strings
  and create symbolic expressions from them. The idea with added
  features was implemented in sympycore by Pearu.

* The code of Sympy Core is based on the development of the
  sympy-sandbox branch of the SymPy project SVN repository. The branch
  as well as subsequent development of the sympycore package is
  carried out by Pearu Peterson during the year 2007.

* The Sympy Core project started by Pearu Peterson is closely related
  to the SymPy project

    http://sympy.googlecode.com/

  which was established by Ondrej Certik in autumn 2006.

  The Sympy Core tries to provide an efficient, robust, and complete
  implementations of the core part of a Computer Algebra System for
  Python and it is the aim of this project that the SymPy project will
  use sympycore for that in future.  

Third-party software
--------------------

Sympy Core includes the following third-party software:

* mpmath package (SVN revision 189) developed by Fredrik Johansson:

    http://mpmath.googlecode.com/

  The package is used as a backend for arbitrary precision floating
  point number support.

  In the recent development of sympycore the user is assumed to use
  globally installed mpmath 0.6 or newer version.

* qm module (v0.1) developed by Robert Dick:

    http://ziyang.ece.northwestern.edu/~dickrp/python/mods.html

  The module implements Quine-McCluskey two-level logic minimization
  method that is used to evaluate boolean expressions.
